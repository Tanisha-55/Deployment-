Demo Script: Deployment Assistant Extension
Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Deployment Assistant: AI-Powered Database Deployment
Subtitle: Automating DevOps with VS Code and Copilot
Presenter: Your Name
Date: [Date of Demo]

Slide 2: The Problem (The "Why")
"Manual database deployment is slow, error-prone, and repetitive."

Scenario: A developer needs to deploy a new version of a database.

The Pain:

Analysis: Manually analyze a CSV file (Script_Metadata.csv) to figure out the order of executing dozens, sometimes hundreds, of SQL scripts.

Cleansing: Many SQL scripts from different developers might have minor syntax issues, missing semicolons, or platform-specific commands that need to be cleaned.

Execution: Log into a remote server, copy files, and run them manually, hoping the order was correct.

Consequences: This process is boring, takes hours, and a single mistake can break the deployment, leading to downtime.

Slide 3: The Solution (The "What")
"What if we could automate this entire workflow inside VS Code, guided by an AI assistant?"

Introducing the Deployment Assistant extension.

AI-Powered: Uses GitHub Copilot to intelligently generate and clean code.

Integrated: Works seamlessly within the VS Code environment you already use.

Automated: Turns a manual, multi-hour process into a single command or chat message.

Chat Interface: You can literally talk to your deployment process. "Hey, start the deployment."

Slide 4: High-Level Architecture & Workflow
"Here's how it works under the hood."

(Show the Mermaid diagram from the previous answer or a simplified version)

User triggers the extension via Command or Chat.

The Extension handles the request.

It reads the necessary files from your workspace (CSV, .md instructions).

It calls the Copilot Language Model API to generate a shell script and cleanse SQL files.

It executes the generated script on a Remote Server via SSH.

Results are fed back to the user in VS Code.

Slide 5: Deep Dive - The Code (The "How" - Part 1)
"Let's look at the key parts of the code that make this magic happen."

1. Activation & Registration:

typescript
// This runs when the extension starts
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    // Register the command for the palette
    context.subscriptions.push(
        vscode.commands.registerCommand('deployment-assistant.start', () => {
            provider.startDeployment();
        })
    );

    // Try to register the chat participant for Copilot interaction
    const chatParticipant = chatAPI.createChatParticipant(
        'deployment-assistant.chat',
        async (request, context, response, token) => {
            return provider.handleChatRequest(request, context, response, token);
        }
    );
}
Key Point: We integrate with two VS Code systems: the Command Palette and the new Chat API.

Slide 6: Deep Dive - The Code (The "How" - Part 2)
2. The Brain: Talking to Copilot

typescript
private async getCopilotResponse(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    // 1. Check if the AI API is available
    if (!(vscode as any).lm) { ... }

    // 2. Find available models (Copilot)
    const lm = (vscode as any).lm;
    const models = await lm.selectChatModels({ vendor: 'GitHub' });

    // 3. Send our detailed prompt
    const messages = [ { role: 'user', content: prompt } ];
    const chatResponse = await model.sendRequest(messages, {}, token);

    // 4. Stream the response back
    let responseText = '';
    for await (const fragment of chatResponse.text) {
        responseText += fragment;
    }
    return responseText;
}
Key Point: We use the official VS Code Language Model API to get structured, secure responses from Copilot, not a random web API.

Slide 7: Deep Dive - The Code (The "How" - Part 3)
3. The Muscle: Remote Execution

typescript
private async executeShellScript(workspacePath: string) {
    // Build the SSH command
    const sshCommand = 'ssh -K kumarita@ivapp1231650.devin3.ms.com';
    const fullCommand = `${sshCommand} "cd ${workspacePath} && ./gendb2ddl.sh"`;

    // Execute it as a child process
    child_process.exec(fullCommand, { cwd: workspacePath }, 
        (error, stdout, stderr) => {
        if (error) {
            this.log(`Error: ${error}`);
        } else {
            this.log(`Success! Output: ${stdout}`);
        }
    });
}
Key Point: The extension leverages the local SSH client to run the AI-generated script on the target server, just like a DevOps engineer would, but automatically.

Slide 8: Live Demo Setup - Prerequisites
"Before you can use it, here's what you need:"

VS Code Insiders Edition: (Essential!) The Chat API is only available in the latest Insiders build.

An Active GitHub Copilot Subscription: The extension is a "participant" that uses your Copilot.

SSH Access Configured: You need password-less SSH access (e.g., using keys) to your target server.

The Project Workspace: Your VS Code workspace must contain:

Script_Metadata.csv (Your list of scripts)

readcsvscript.md (Instructions for Copilot on how to generate the script)

cleansingscripts.md (Instructions for Copilot on how to clean SQL)

A rawddlscripts/ folder full of .sql files.

Slide 9: Live Demo - Step by Step
"Now, let's see it in action!"

(Share your screen and open VS Code Insiders)

Step 1: Show the Workspace

Open the Script_Metadata.csv file to show the complexity.

Open the readcsvscript.md to show the clear instructions for the AI.

Open the rawddlscripts/ folder to show the raw SQL files.

Step 2: Activate via Chat (The Cool Way)

Click the chat icon in the activity bar.

Type @DeploymentAssistant start deployment.

Narrate: "I'm just asking the assistant to start, like I would ask a colleague."

Show the output channel (View > Output -> select "Deployment Assistant") logging every step.

*"Reading CSV..."`

*"Calling Copilot..."`

*"Script generated and saved..."`

"Executing via SSH...Success!"

Show the newly generated gendb2ddl.sh file.

Show the cleansed files in the scriptedfiles/ directory.

Step 3: Activate via Command (The Classic Way)

Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.

Type Start Deployment Assistant Chat.

Show that it does the exact same thing. "This is for users who prefer traditional commands."

Slide 10: Benefits & Conclusion
"To summarize, the Deployment Assistant extension:"

Eliminates Human Error: The AI follows instructions precisely every time.

Saves Significant Time: Cuts a manual process down to a single click or message.

Leverages Existing Tools: Uses the power of Copilot and VS Code you already have.

Is Built on Modern APIs: Demonstrates the future of IDE-powered AI assistants.

Improves Developer Happiness: Frees up engineers from boring tasks to focus on complex problems.

"It's not just automation; it's intelligent collaboration between the developer and AI."

Slide 11: Q&A
Anticipated Questions & Answers:

Q: Is my data sent to GitHub?

A: Yes, but through the official and secure VS Code Copilot API. The prompts and code are subject to Copilot's privacy terms.

Q: Can I use it with my company's internal database/server?

A: Absolutely! The SSH server address is hardcoded now (ivapp1231650.devin3.ms.com) as a proof-of-concept. For a real-world version, we'd make this a configurable setting in VS Code.

Q: What if Copilot gives a wrong or bad script?

A: This is a great point. The extension is a copilot, not an autopilot. The key is writing very clear instructions in the readcsvscript.md file. The developer is always in control and should review the generated gendb2ddl.sh script before executing it. The extension could be enhanced with a confirmation dialog.

Q: How do I install this extension?

A: Currently, since it's a demo, it's run from source code. To distribute it, we would package it into a .vsix file and publish it to the VS Code Marketplace or a private gallery.

Q: Does it work with Windows?

A: The core extension does. The SSH part requires a Windows machine with an SSH client (like the one that comes with Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL). The shell script (gendb2ddl.sh) itself is a Unix shell script.
